## **Project Description**  

The goal of this project is to classify crop types based on various land characteristics, such as soil quality, moisture, and other environmental factors. The workflow includes **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and building a machine learning model with fine-tuning to ensure accurate predictions.

This project is particularly helpful for farmers and agricultural experts to optimize crop management and improve decision-making in agriculture.
